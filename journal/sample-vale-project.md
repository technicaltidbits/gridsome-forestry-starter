## Prerequisites

* A code editor, like VS Code or Atom

## Assumptions

* You've read [this](https://technicaltidbits.net/projects/config-vale/) post about the basics of the Vale configuration file.
* You have some familiarity with the command line.

## Step one: Create project folder

In the terminal, create a new folder called `vale-tutorial`:

```bash
user$ mkdir vale-tutorial
```

## Step two: Add project files

Change directories to the `vale-tutorial` file:

```bash
user$ cd vale-tutorial
```

Inside this folder, create a `styles` folder:

```bash
user$ mkdir styles
```

Then, create a `.vale.ini` file:

```bash
user$ touch .vale.ini
```

Finally, in the project folder, create a Markdown file called `sample-file`:

```bash
user$ touch sample-file.md
```

Your project structure should look like this:

```
TODO
```
